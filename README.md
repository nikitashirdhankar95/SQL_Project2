ðŸŒ¾ Smart Farming Sensor Data for Yield Prediction



Goal
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the influence of various environmental and operational factorsâ€”such as temperature, rainfall, soil quality, and irrigation methodsâ€”on crop yield. The aim is to gain insights that can optimize agricultural practices, predict yields accurately, and improve decision-making for sustainable farming.

Skills Demonstrated
1.	SQL Data Analysis: Proficient use of AVG, GROUP BY, COUNT, and other aggregate functions to analyze trends and relationships within large datasets.
2.	Critical Thinking & Problem Solving: Designing queries and interpreting results to derive meaningful conclusions about agricultural outcome

Tools & Technologies Used
1.	SQL: For querying the dataset and calculating metrics such as average yields, disease impact, and irrigation effectiveness.
2.	GitHub: Showcasing project outcomes in a professional portfolio for enhanced visibility.
Key Insights & Results

1.	Yield Optimization:
o	Identified the crop types and regions with the highest average yields, guiding strategic farming decisions.
2.	Impact of Environmental Factors:
o	Revealed how temperature, rainfall, and humidity during the growing period influence vegetation health (NDVI index).
3.	Disease Management:
o	Quantified the severity of crop disease impact (None, Mild, Severe) and its correlation with yield.
4.	Operational Efficiency:
o	Showed how irrigation and fertilizer types contribute to yield variations, enabling better resource allocation.
5.	Sustainability Insights:
o	Highlighted key practices that align with sustainable farming, like maintaining balanced soil pH and effective sunlight utilization.
